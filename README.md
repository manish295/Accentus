# Accentus

## What was your Inspiration?
Accentus was an idea that had come from the very core of our minds we had personally seen the effects of overloaded schedules and extracurriculars which negatively impacted their mental health. The stress and intensity of school can truly hurt a person's ability to function socially and in school. To combat this we have created Accentus a website that gauges a person's intensity level and adds them to a forum where they can discuss and collaborate questions about classes or just life. We are here to bring people together for a mentally healthier society.

## What does Accentus do?
Accentus first asks users to create an account and then sign into the account. After signing in users get to input their class schedules and various activities which they do outside of school. Then our Algorithm uses the information given to put the user into a certain category for intensity where they will be able to interact with other users who are also in the same exact intensity level. Users can also see their profile and see our suggestions for them and what to do to boost their mental health.

## How did we build it?
First, we set up the database containing posts, comments, and user info using PostgreSQL. We used foreign key relational mapping to link tables with each other so that posts, comments, etc. can be in their respective category. The back end was built in python using the Flask framework and the front end was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap were used for the user interface and Javascript was used for calculating the intensity level.

## Some Challenges we ran into:
One huge challenge which we ran into was setting up all the databases and linking them to make sure they communicate together and keep the data categorized and secure. We also had to develop the Algorithm to determine intensity levels for the users which was head-scratching as we had to spend many hours trying to implement a functioning system and fine-tune it to perfection.

## Our Accomplishments ðŸ’ª:
We are proud of setting up the database in a way that connects with each other and categorizes itself. We are also proud of coming up with an intuitive algorithm that predicts a student's intensity level. Finally, we are proud of being able to put all of these systems together and have them work seamlessly.

## Here's what we learnt:
Throughout the project, we learned the ins and outs of Bootstrap and CSS styling to display to users how we want to help them and care for them. We also learned relational mapping in the PostgreSQL database to store the intensities and accounts for all the users logging in.

## What's next for Accentus?
We plan on adding more features that can enhance the User Interface and the User Experience. These include options to delete posts and comments and adding more mental health suggestions based on a feedback system.
